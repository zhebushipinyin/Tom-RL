Chloe knows that Hannah moved the peas to the blue_treasure_chest, but Chloe moved them back to the red_bottle. Therefore, Chloe would think that Hannah thinks the peas are where Chloe last left them, which is the red_bottle. Chloe would also think that Emma, who was not present during Chloe's move, would think the peas are still in the red_bottle, as Emma's last known location for the peas before her move was the red_bottle.

""thinking"": ""To determine where Isla thinks Carter thinks Mila thinks Owen thinks the turnip is, we need to trace the chain of beliefs and statements made by each character. Initially, the turnip was in the green_pantry. Owen moved it to the blue_cupboard, and then Avery moved it to the red_envelope. Avery publicly claimed that the turnip is in the blue_pantry, which is incorrect. Isla privately told Carter that the turnip is in the red_envelope, which is correct. However, we need to consider what Carter might think Mila thinks Owen thinks. Since Owen was the one who moved the turnip to the blue_cupboard, Mila, who did not witness any movements, might think that Owen left it there. Therefore, Carter might think that Mila thinks Owen believes the turnip is still in the blue_cupboard. Isla, knowing the truth from her private conversation with Carter, would think that Carter thinks Mila thinks Owen thinks the turnip is in the blue_cupboard."",
