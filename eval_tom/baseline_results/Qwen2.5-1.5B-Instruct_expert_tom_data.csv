- Since the customs officer cannot see the contents, they rely on the information provided in the shipping documents.
- The documents state it contains sugar, which is not physically present.

Therefore, the customs officer would think that the container contains sugar, as stated on the shipping documents.

Choose one of the following: (yes or no)",3,ToM,"{
""thinking"": ""Step-by-step thinking"",
""answer"": ""Yes, Sarah would assume her shoes are under her dress.""
}

Reasoning:
1. The story states that Sarah placed her high heel shoes under her dress before going shopping.
2. Later that afternoon, her sister borrowed the shoes and put them under Sarah's bed.
3. When Sarah gets ready, she would have access to her own shoes.
4. Given that Sarah has control over her own possessions and has been in the same room as her shoes, she would naturally assume that her shoes are under her dress, not under her sister's bed.
5. The scenario suggests that Sarah's sister is likely to have access to her sister's room, which could explain why the shoes were put under Sarah's bed.
6. The context of the story implies that Sarah's sister is likely to be present when Sarah gets ready, making it less likely that the shoes would be under her bed.
Therefore, Sarah would naturally assume that her shoes are under her dress when she gets ready.",0

Choose one of the following: (in the box; in the basket; he has no guess),8,ToM,"To answer this question, let's break down the information provided step-by-step:

1. Initially, John puts the cat in the basket.
   - This is a private interaction between John and the cat.

2. John leaves the room.
   - This breaks the private interaction.

3. Mark calls John to tell him he is going to move the cat to the box.
   - This is a public interaction between Mark and John.

4. John believes Mark's statement.
   - This is an inference based on the public interaction between Mark and John.

5. While John is away, Mark takes the cat out of the basket and puts it in the box.
   - This is a private interaction between Mark and the cat.

6. Mark leaves the room.
   - This breaks the private interaction.

7. John comes back from school and enters the room.
   - This breaks the private interaction with Mark.

8. John doesn't know what happened in the room when he was away.
   - This indicates that he doesn't have any information about what Mark did with the cat.

Given these steps, we can conclude that John believes the cat is in the box, based on Mark's public statement. The private interaction between Mark and the cat was broken when Mark left the room, so John wouldn't have any information about what happened to the cat during that time.

Therefore, the answer is: John believes the cat is in the box.",0
"In the room there are John, Mark, a cat, a box, and a basket. John takes the cat and puts it in the basket. He leaves the room and goes to school. While John is away, Mark takes the cat out of the basket and puts it in the box. Mark leaves the room and goes to work. John and Mark come back and enter the room. They don't know what happened in the room when they were away.",Where does John believe the cat is?,in the basket,ullman2023,(in the basket; in the box; he has no guess),Where does John believe the cat is? Choose one of the following: (in the basket; in the box; he has no guess),9,ToM,"To answer this question, let's break down the story step-by-step:

1. Initially, John takes the cat and puts it in the basket.
   - John believes the cat is in the basket.

2. John leaves the room to go to school.
   - John cannot know the exact location of the cat at this point.

3. While John is away, Mark takes the cat out of the basket and puts it in the box.
   - Mark has now changed the cat's location from the basket to the box.
   - Mark is aware of the cat's new location in the box.

4. Mark leaves the room and goes to work.
   - Mark cannot know the exact location of the cat at this point.

5. John and Mark return to the room.
   - John believes the cat is in the basket because that's where John put it initially.
   - Mark cannot know the exact location of the cat at this point.

Given these steps, John believes the cat is in the basket. Mark, on the other hand, is unaware of the cat's new location in the box.

Therefore, the answer is: John believes the cat is in the basket.",0

4. Emma asked ""What do you mean?""
5. Alice replied ""Oh nothing.""

(1999),,What kind of pie had Kate made?,3,Control,"To answer this question, let's break it down step-by-step:

1. The story mentions that Kate helped her Mum make a fruit pie for her neighbor.
2. The neighbor then said, ""That looks lovely - I love pies, especially fruit ones!""
3. This information directly tells us what type of pie Kate made.

Based on these points, we can conclude that Kate made a fruit pie. The neighbor's comment specifically indicates that Kate made a fruit pie, as she described it as ""fruit ones.""

Therefore, the answer is: A fruit pie.",0

1. Kate made a fruit pie for her neighbor.
2. The neighbor complimented the pie, saying ""That looks lovely - I love pies, especially fruit ones! ""
3. The neighbor is the one saying the pie looks lovely, not Kate.
4. Since Kate is the one who made the pie, it's more likely that she is the one who knows about its contents.

Given this reasoning, the most probable answer is:

3. Mrs. Smith rang the doorbell.
4. Mrs. Smith looked at Jill and said ""Oh, I don't think I've met this little girl.""
5. Uncle Ted asked if anyone wanted tea.

Based on these points, we can infer the following:

- Jill is a little girl because she has short brown hair.
- Mrs. Smith has not met Jill before, as she said ""I don't think I've met this little girl.""
- Uncle Ted was asking if anyone wanted tea, but there is no mention of Mrs. Smith knowing Jill as a little girl at this point.

Explanation: 
1. The teacher informed the class that Simon is very seriously ill.
2. Becky arrived late and asked a joke about sick people.
3. The teacher told Becky to sit down and get on with her work.

Given these facts, it is highly unlikely that Becky knew Simon was sick. The teacher did not mention anything about Becky knowing Simon's condition, and the teacher did not address Becky's question about the joke. Therefore, based on the information provided, it is most probable that Becky did not know Simon was sick.",1
"Mrs. Jones, the teacher, had something to tell her class, ""You all know George in our class, well, he is very seriously ill"" she said. The class were all very sad and were sitting quietly when a little girl, Amy, arrived late. ""I've just been to the dentist"" she said. The teacher said to her ""Sit down and get on with your work.""","In the story did someone say something that they should not have said? Answer with ""Yes"" or ""No"" only, without explanations. In case of doubt, answer according to the most probable answer.",No,Baron-Cohen et al. (1999),,In the story did someone say something that they should not have said? Answer yes or no.,1,Control,"To determine if someone said something they should not have said, let's analyze the story step by step:

1. Mrs. Jones announces that George is very seriously ill.
2. The class is initially saddened and quiet.
3. A little girl, Amy, arrives late and says she has just been to the dentist.
4. The teacher asks Amy to sit down and continue her work.

Now, let's consider the most probable answer:

Amy's statement about going to the dentist is likely a harmless lie. The teacher's question about sitting down and continuing work seems appropriate given Amy's presence. There is no indication that Amy's statement was made maliciously or that it caused distress to the class.

Therefore, based on the information provided, it is most probable that someone did not say something they should not have said.

1. Helen's mum was having a surprise party for Helen's birthday.
2. Nicky and Helen were playing together the day before the party.
3. Nicky said, ""Don't tell anyone, especially Helen!"" after ripping Helen's new dress.
4. Nicky then said, ""What party?"" when asked about the dress tear.
5. Nicky asked Helen to come with him to see if his mum could mend the tear.

Given these details, we can infer that Nicky was aware of the surprise party and the dress tear. However, the most probable answer is that Nicky did not remember the party being a surprise, because:

1. Nicky was playing with Helen and had no reason to know about the surprise party.
2. Nicky had no way of knowing that Helen was going to a birthday party.
3. The fact that Helen didn't know about the party until Nicky mentioned it suggests that Nicky was the one who was unaware of the surprise.

Answer yes or no.,1,FauxPas,"To determine if anyone in the story said something they should not have said, let's think through this step-by-step:

1. The story is about Abby learning to write from her father.
2. David, the teacher, is introducing the class to different types of writing.
3. David shows the class a story written by Abby's father.
4. David then gives the class a good example of a writer named Pichnik and asks them to identify the differences.

Given these points, we can infer that David is likely trying to educate the class and provide examples of good writing. This is a common practice in educational settings.

However, the story doesn't explicitly state what David said or how he said it. The only relevant information we have is that David is teaching and providing examples.

Based on the information provided, there is no clear indication that David said something inappropriate or unethical. The story doesn't contain any hints or clues that suggest David said something that should not have been said.

1. Michelle's mother bought a new dress for her niece Ayala.
2. The dress was placed on the chair in the kitchen.
3. Michelle's mother called ""Michelle get ready for dinner"" while arranging the table.
4. Michelle went down and noticed the dress.
5. Michelle exclaimed, ""What a beautiful dress! It's for Ayala's birthday right?""

Given these details:
- Michelle was in the same room as the dress when she noticed it.
- She was called by her mother to get ready for dinner, which implies they were in the kitchen.
- Michelle directly stated, ""It's for Ayala's birthday right?""

Based on these facts, it is highly probable that Michelle knew the dress was for Ayala. The combination of being in the same room, being called to get ready for dinner, and directly stating it's for Ayala's birthday all strongly suggest Michelle understood the dress was for Ayala.

Therefore, the answer is:

Jessica says, ""Annie! I haven't seen you in so long"" and ""Congratulations!"".

Step 3: Determine if Jessica's statement about Annie's pregnancy is relevant to the fetus's condition.
Jessica's statement about Annie's pregnancy is not directly related to the fetus's condition. It is a casual greeting and a congratulatory message.

Step 4: Based on the available information, conclude whether Jessica knew about the fetus's condition.
The story does not provide any information about Jessica knowing about the fetus's condition. Therefore, we cannot conclude that Jessica knew about the fetus's no pulse.

I will analyze the relevant information from the story:
1. Diana hesitated before going to the party, likely due to her emotional state.
2. Diana mentioned her mother's death when asked about her well-being.
3. Emily mentioned her old friend Diana hadn't seen her in years.
4. Emily and Diana had not been in the same room together.
5. Emily didn't know about Diana's mother's death because they had not been in the same room and they hadn't had private or public interactions.

Based on this analysis, I can conclude that Emily did not know that Diana's mother had passed away.

1. The CEO informed the team that the company was going bankrupt.
2. Later, Jane entered the room and the CEO confirmed this information.
3. Jane then went on to say she heard the CEO say the company was going bankrupt.

Given this information, we can infer that Jane likely overheard the CEO's statement about the company's bankruptcy. However, there's no explicit indication in the story that Jane intended to share this information with anyone else.

The story doesn't provide any information about Jane's motives or intentions regarding the information she overheard. She could have heard it accidentally, or she could have intentionally shared it with someone else.

Without more context about Jane's actions or intentions, we cannot definitively say that Jane should not have said what she did. The story doesn't give us enough information to make a confident judgment.

Therefore, based on the given information, the answer is:

In case of doubt answer according to the most probable answer.",No,Shapira et al. (2023),,Did John remember that Larry helped him find a job Answer yes or no.,4,FauxPas,"To answer this question, let's think through it step-by-step:

1. The story states that Larry helped John find a job.
2. The story mentions that John and Larry met again after several years.
3. When John greeted Larry, he said ""Hey Larry! How are you? "" and Larry responded ""Good thanks and how about you? How's it going? ""
4. John then said ""I hate my job. Too bad I started working there at all.""

Given this information, we need to consider whether John remembered Larry helping him find a job.

1. The greeting ""Hey Larry! How are you? "" suggests a familiar greeting, which could indicate they have met before.
2. The response ""Good thanks and how about you? How's it going? "" is a common way to greet someone and check in, which also suggests familiarity.
3. John's statement ""I hate my job. Too bad I started working there at all"" implies that he was unhappy with his job from the beginning.

Given these points, it's highly probable that John remembered Larry helping him find a job. The greeting and response are consistent with a familiar encounter, and John's statement about hating his job strongly indicates he was aware of the situation from a previous interaction.

Therefore, the answer is:
Yes",0

1. The story states that an agent witnesses everything and every movement before exiting a room.
2. It also mentions that an agent A can infer another agent B's mental state only if A and B have been in the same room, or have private or public interactions.
3. We need to determine if Emily knew that Tim, their boss, was sitting in the next room and hearing everything.
4. The story doesn't explicitly state that Emily knew this information.
5. However, we can infer that Emily would have knowledge of the boss's location if it was relevant to her actions or decisions.
6. Emily's actions (telling Tim about the proposal) suggest she knew the boss was in the next room.
7. Given the information provided, it's most likely that Emily knew the boss was sitting in the next room and hearing everything.

- The story mentions that their boss was sitting in the next room and was ""hearing everything"". This suggests the boss was aware of all the conversations.
- Mike proposed an idea and added that it was expensive but sounded interesting to him.
- Emily then said she believed the proposal had potential and they should consider it carefully.
- Mike then proposed sharing the idea with the management.

1. Dima is the agent in this scenario.
2. Henry is the other agent.
3. We know Henry was discussing a project with Dima.
4. Dima mentioned that he had a newborn baby.
5. Henry asked Dima if there was anything he should consider.
6. The question asks if Henry knew Dima had a new born baby.

Given the information provided:
- Dima mentioned the baby, but there's no indication that Henry knew about it.
- Henry's question about considering something suggests he was not directly informed about Dima's personal situation.

Therefore, based on the information given and the logical flow of the conversation, the most probable answer is:

No

Henry did not know about Dima's new born baby. The mention of the baby was likely a casual observation by Dima, not a direct communication between Henry and Dima regarding the baby's existence.",0
