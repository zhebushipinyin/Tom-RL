""thinking"": ""The story provides several clues that can help determine George's thoughts about Amy's health. First, Amy's car is in the drive, suggesting she is at work. Second, Amy's room is quiet and dark, which is consistent with the information that Amy lies down in a dark room when she is sick. However, Amy is at work, so she cannot be in her dark room. The only logical conclusion is that George is aware of this discrepancy and is likely thinking that Amy is not sick, as she is at work and not in her dark room."",
