Jack then leaves and Alexander leaves right after. Hannah exits before Jack changes the location of the orange. Therefore, when Alexander leaves, he thinks the orange is in the last place he saw it before he left, which is red_pantry. Hannah leaves before Jack changes the orange's location. So Alexander thinks Jack thinks Hannah thinks the orange is in red_pantry. </think>

Amelia then moves persimmon to green_pantry and exits. The persimmon is not touched after that. When Ava leaves, she last saw persimmon in blue_crate. She did not interact with persimmon after that. So, Ava leaves before persimmon is moved to red_crate, blue_cupboard or green_pantry. Hence, when Ava exits the bathroom, she leaves the persimmon in blue_crate. Ava did not interact with persimmon after she leaves the bathroom. So, when Ava leaves, she thinks persimmon is in blue_crate. Charlotte, Evelyn, and Amelia make changes to persimmon later, but Ava did not have any interactions with persimmon after she leaves.

Abigail exits before the spinach is moved, and she dislikes spinach. After that, Isla privately tells Jack the location of the spinach but Abigail does not interact with this information. Abigail leaves before the spinach is moved, so she only knows its initial location. Abigail publicly leaves the sunroom before the spinach is moved. So, when Abigail leaves, she only knows the spinach is in green_pantry. Abigail exits before the spinach is moved to green_pantry again by Isla. Abigail leaves before Jack publicly claims and Isla privately tells Jack. So, when Abigail leaves, she still thinks the spinach is in green_pantry. The question asks where Benjamin thinks Abigail thinks the spinach is. Since Abigail leaves before the spinach is moved, and she does not interact with the information of Isla's move, she leaves thinking the spinach is in green_pantry.
