"Amy walked to work today. When George woke up, he saw her car in the drive. Her room was quiet and dark. George knows that when Amy is sick, she lies down in a dark room.",Does George think Amy is sick today?,yes,dodell-feder,"Based on the information given:
- Amy walked to work today.
- When George woke up, he saw her car in the drive.
- Her room was quiet and dark.
- It's noted that when Amy is sick, she lies down in a dark room.

Analyzing these points:
- Amy's car being in the drive suggests she went to work, implying she is not sick and does not need to lie down in a dark room to recover.
- The fact that Amy walked to work contradicts the idea that she is sick, as someone who is sick typically does not go to work.
- Her room being quiet and dark might be because she went to work (as people leave for work in the morning), not because she is sick.
Given this information, it appears that George knows Amy's behavior when she is sick, but the evidence (her car in the drive and her going to work) does not support the conclusion that Amy is sick today. Therefore, George does not think Amy is sick today.

John told Mary that he had lost his keys. The two of them searched the house with no luck. Then Mary went outside to look in the car. Suddenly John noticed his keys behind the sofa.,"By the time Mary comes in, does John know where his keys are?",yes,dodell-feder,"According to the information given:
- John initially told Mary he had lost his keys.
- They searched the house together but couldn't find them.
- Then Mary went outside to look in the car.
- John noticed his keys behind the sofa.
The key point here is that John found his keys behind the sofa before Mary came back inside. This means that John's knowledge about the location of his keys has changed.

"At night a bear broke into a cooler near a tent and drank the soda. Five hours later, the campers woke up and went to their cooler for breakfast.",Do the campers find their cooler empty of soda?,yes,dodell-feder,"According to the information given:
- A bear broke into a cooler near a tent.
- The bear drank the soda.
- Five hours later, campers woke up and went to their cooler for breakfast.
The action of the bear drinking the soda implies that the soda was consumed. This means that the quantity of soda within the cooler would be reduced or possibly empty, depending on how much the bear drank. The campers' action of going to the cooler for breakfast five hours later is a sequence of events indicating they checked the cooler.
Given the bear's actions, it is logical to conclude that the campers would find their cooler empty of soda or significantly reduced in quantity. The question asks if the campers find their cooler empty of soda, which can be true if the bear drank all the soda.
