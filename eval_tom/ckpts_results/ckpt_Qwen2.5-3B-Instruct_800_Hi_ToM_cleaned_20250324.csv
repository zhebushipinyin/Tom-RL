Since Carter is the last agent to last have seen the turnip in the green_pantry, when Mila made no movements and stayed in the sunroom for 1 minute, Mila would most likely think Owen still thinks the turnip is in the green_pantry. Therefore, Isla would think Carter still thinks Owen still thinks the turnip is in the green_pantry.</think>
