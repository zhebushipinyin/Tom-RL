Avery exits before any movements are made with the cherry. Ava exits after seeing the cherry in blue_container. When Ava exits, the cherry is still in blue_container. Ava exits before William enters, so she does not witness the movement to green_bucket. William exits before any changes are made. When Ava exits, she leaves the cellar thinking the cherry is in blue_container. Logan moves the cherry later to green_bucket, but this does not affect Ava's thought. Logan leaves before Ava exits, so he does not see Ava's thought. Amelia privately is told by William that cherry is in blue_container, but this does not affect Ava's thought. Ava exits before the discussion about green_bucket, green_pantry, green_pantry, green_basket, blue_container. So when Amelia thinks about where Logan thinks Ava thinks the cherry is, it must be in blue_container, as that is the last place Ava saw it before she left. </think>
