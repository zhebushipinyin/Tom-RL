Since Carter is the last person to have moved the turnip, when Mila last saw the turnip, it is most likely still in the green_pantry. Therefore, when Mila and Owen last saw the turnip, they would likely still think it is in the green_pantry. Thus, when Isla thinks Carter still thinks Mila thinks Owen still thinks the turnip is in the green_pantry.</think>
