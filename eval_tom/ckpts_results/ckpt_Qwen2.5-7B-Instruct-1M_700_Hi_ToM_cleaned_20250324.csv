When Avery leaves, the watermelon is still in the blue_container. Owen leaves before anyone touches the watermelon after Avery puts it in the blue_container. So at the point when Avery leaves, the watermelon is in the blue_container. Avery leaves before Ella changes the location of the watermelon, so Avery leaves thinking the watermelon is in the blue_container. Ella then leaves without touching the watermelon, so she leaves thinking the watermelon is in the blue_container. When Owen leaves, he leaves before anyone touches the watermelon, so he leaves thinking the watermelon is in the blue_container. This means when Ella leaves, she leaves the watermelon in the red_pantry but she thinks it was last in blue_container when she left.

Mila leaves before any change in turnip location. So, when Carter leaves, the turnip is still in green_pantry. Mila leaves before any movement regarding the turnip. So, when Mila leaves, the turnip is still in green_pantry. Owen moves the turnip to blue_cupboard when he leaves. This is before Mila leaves. When Carter exits, he leaves before any change in turnip location. So, Carter exits thinking the turnip is in green_pantry. Mila leaves before any change in turnip location.
